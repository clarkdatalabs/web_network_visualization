# Web_network_visualization

## Introduction

  This tutorial will show how to build a web-network visulization. The theme we visualize in the example is the web-network of different types of beer. To read this tutorial, the audience should have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
  Conceptually, we have divided the tutorial into three difficulty levels: Beginner, Moderate, and Advanced. 
  - For Beginner, we'll introduce a simple way to set up your local server to check the effect of the code. We'll provide the code, with simple and clear explenation accordingly, for you to copy/paste on your own computer to further play with. 
  - For Moderate, we'll talk about how to manipulate your own data in D3 from csv file. And related D3 events, like mouseover/out and clicks, will be introduced in this section.
  - For advanced, we'd like to explore more interesting possibilities that can be realized by D3. If you're interested in fancy and innovated data visualization, come check it!
