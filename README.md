# web_network_visualization

## Using D3 to visualize beer relationships :beers:

You don’t need to be an expert in web development to get started with a network visualization in D3 however we do make some assumptions about our audience.

We assume that:
* You’ve had experience with another programming such as Python, Java, or C++
* You have some working knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript

Regardless of skill level, our hope is to get you up and running with a simple network visualization and slowly build more complexity as we move forward.

### Step 0 - Getting Started
* Download the zip file to this project to your local computer
* Drag the zip file to your Desktop or somewhere where you can have easy access to the files
* Unzip the files	

Typically, you’d be able to right click on the **index.html** file and open it with a web browser to render the webpage. If you try this, you’ll likely notice that D3 doesn’t render. This is because we need a server to run D3.

### Step 1 - Running a Local Server on your computer
An easy way to get set up with a local server is to use Python. If you don’t know Python, do not fret. The set up is well documented. The first thing you’ll need to do is make sure your computer has Python3 loaded or higher.
* You can check what version of Python you have by following these instructions:https://edu.google.com/openonline/course-builder/docs/1.10/set-up-course-builder/check-for-python.html
* If you don’t have Python3 or higher, download the latest version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Once you’ve finished setting up Python3 or if you already have it, jump to the **Terminal** if you’re on a Mac or the **Command Prompt** on Windows
* Use the command line to navigate to the location of the project files. If you saved the project files to your Desktop, try:
``` cd Desktop/Beer-Project ```
