## Using D3 to visualize beer relationships :metal

You don’t need to be an expert in web development to get started with a network visualization in D3 however we do make some assumptions about our audience.

We assume that
* You’ve had experience with another programming such as Python, Java, or C++
* You have some working knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript

Regardless of skill level, our hope is to get you up and running with a simple network visualization and slowly build more complexity as we move forward.

### Step 0 - Getting Started
* Download the zip file to this project to your local computer
* Drag the zip file to your Desktop or somewhere where you can have easy access to the files
* Unzip the files	

Typically, you’d be able to right click on the **index.html** file and open it with a web browser to render the webpage. If you try this, you’ll likely notice that D3 doesn’t render. This is because we need a server to run D3.

#### What is SimpleServer?
SimpleServer is a wrapper application that tunnels traffic to a local minecraft server. It provides extra functionality, grief protection, and admin functionality. SimpleServer launches and modifies traffic going to and from the minecraft server. It does not modify the server itself, and so it cannot provide a plugin/API/addon interface (such as within bukkit or hMod).
