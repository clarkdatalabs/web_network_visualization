## Using D3 to visualize beer relationships

You don’t need to be an expert in web development to get started with a network visualization in D3 however we do make some assumptions about our audience.

We assume that
* You’ve had experience with another programming such as Python, Java, or C++
* You have some working knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript

Regardless of skill level, our hope is to get you up and running with a simple network visualization and slowly build more complexity as we move forward.
